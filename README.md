# Code Guide

This is a fork of @mdo's Code Guide, tweaked for the needs of tbk Creative.

Code Guide is a project for documenting standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS. It comes from years of experience writing code on projects of all sizes. It's not the end-all be-all, but it's a start.
